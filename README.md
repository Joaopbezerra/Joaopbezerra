- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m you JoÃ£o Paulo Bezerra dos Santos

I have extensive experience in civil construction, especially in engineering and construction management. Currently, at Direcional Engenharia, I focus on Post-Construction Technical Assistance, ensuring customer satisfaction and the smooth functioning of common areas. In previous roles at Manserv and Hersa Engenharia, I developed skills in planning, maintenance control and public works. With six years at Vitta Residencial, I acquired expertise in production, quality management and residential projects. I also have experience in administrative and warehouse areas, in addition to having worked as a construction worker at MRV, always committed to quality and efficiency.

Furthermore, I have currently been acquiring knowledge in the area of â€‹â€‹Microsoft Power BI for Business Intelligence and Data Science, and Power Platform Fundamentals, where I have been exploring activities such as data analysis, creating interactive dashboards, visualizing information in real time, automating processes and Application development to drive efficiency and decision making.

I constantly seek new challenges and opportunities for growth.
